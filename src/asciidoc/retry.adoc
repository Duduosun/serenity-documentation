Sometimes it is required to retry a failed test. This can be achieved by setting the system properties +junit.retry.tests+ to true and +max.retries+ to the number of times you want failed tests to be retried. If +max.retries+ provided and +junit.retry.tests+=true, all method tests will be executed until first successful run, but not more than 1 + +max.retries+ times.

Here is short example, for it we will use next test class:

[source,java]
----
include::{srcdir}/junit-retries/net/serenity/samples/retries/SampleTest.java[]
----

Steps class:

[source,java]
----
include::{srcdir}/junit-retries/net/serenity/samples/retries/TestSteps.java[]
----

If this test will be executed - it will fail:


[[retry_test_fail]]
.Report with failed scenario
image::retry_test_fail.png[]

If we provide next properties in serenity.property file, framework will execute tests more according to configuration until test will be successful or number of tries will be reached:

----
max.retries=4
junit.retry.tests=true
----

After executing same test it will be successful - because method +then_example_result_should_be+ fails only twice, and third "try" will successful:


[[retry_test_fail]]
.Report with successful scenario
image::retry_test_success.png[]

If you're using Jenkins for aggregating your test results use this folder pattern for JUnit test results:

----
target/site/serenity/SERENITY-JUNIT-*.xml
----

This will exclude the previous failed tests from your report.
